# Import data right from an image

## Overview
SAP LeanIX allows you to easily import data from existing documents, e.g., architecture drawings from existing documentation, or from a recent architecture session with your team or stakeholders. Leveraging AI, you can easily import the items as fact sheets into the inventory.

## Excercise

1. Go to the 'Inventory'
2. Expand the right side panel and open the 'Inventory Builder'
3. Upload an image of choice.

> To get started, you could use one of the bit old diagrams from [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/awsforsap/modernize-your-sap-eco-system-with-sap-btp-and-aws-services) or this from [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/sap/sap-btp-solution-overview)
4. Use the prompt to control the extraction.
5. Once you are happy with the results, push the results to the inbox.
6. Review the data in the inbox, and push the results selectively into the inventory.
