# Link the BTP Solution Diagram elements to the fact sheets

## Overview
In SAP LeanIX, diagrams are not simply "passive" images, but interactive ones. The diagram elemets can be linked to existing or new fact sheets, and existing inventory data can be used to easily create diagrams.

## Excercise

1. Edit the diagram created in the previous excercise.
2. Right-click on any of the shape, and link them to either existing or new fact sheets.
3. Right-click on any of the lines, and create a new relation.
> [!TIP]
> With this approach, you can easily create new fact sheets and relations, e.g., when discussing your architecture with the team or stakeholders - typically a lot faster than ny cresting the fact sheets right in the inventory.
4. Click the big "+" (PLUS) icon and select 'Insert from Inventory', and select 1..5 fact sheets
5. Right click on any of the newly added shapes, select "Show Dependency" and select one of the available relations to add one of the related fact sheets.
6. Save the diagram.
7. Click one of the shapes linked to a fact sheet before. This will open the side panel, showing additional data about the fact sheet, and the link to the fact sheet itself.
