# Create your BTP Account structure in SAP LeanIX

## Overview

The application fact sheet is the place to store all relevant information for your business application, both in form of attributes and relations to other fact sheets.
At the same time, the application inventory is the starting point for most governance and transformation initiatives, hence we start here before going deeper into BTP.

> [!NOTE]
> In a future version, SAP landscape discovery is planned to support automated discovery of your BTP account structure as well as the account-level service subscriptions. Please find details and track progress in  the [corresponding road map item](https://roadmap.leanix.net/c/537-application-discovery-sap-btp-service-discovery)
