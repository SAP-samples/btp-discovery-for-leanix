# Maintain the created fact sheet

## Overview

The application fact sheet is the place to store all relevant information for your business application, both in form of attributes and relations to other fact sheets.
At the same time, the application inventory is the starting point for most governance and transformation initiatives, hence we start here before going deeper into BTP.

## Excercise

1. Open the application fact sheet you created from the SAP inbox
2. Click on "Set your role" and add yourself as the "Business Owner".
3. Scroll through the fact sheet to understand the different dimensions.
4. Populate the description and technical fit
5. Pick 2..5 Business Capabilities that are _supported_ by the application.
6. Assign 1..3 organizations that _use_ the application.
