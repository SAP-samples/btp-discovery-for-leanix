# Create an Application Roadmap in SAP LeanIX

## Overview
With SAP LeanIX Architecture and Road Map Planing you can not only capture your as-is landscape, but you can also plan and capture your to-be landscape. For this, so-called 'Transformations' are used to capture inventory changes for specific points in time or milestones.

## Excercise

1. Open any of the existing 'Application'.
2. Open the 'Transformations' tab, and create a new transformation.
3. First, create a new 'Iniative' to represent the project needed to _implement_ the change.
> [!TIP]
> This is not covered in this hands-on session, but you can link the iniative to a new or existing project in Cloud ALM to connect the planning to execution - and vice-versa.
4. Then, select one of the templates, e.g., 'Introduce New Application'
5. Select one of the applications from the inventory, an org unit and a busines capability, and enter a date in early 2026. Save.
