# The SAP Inbox

## Overview

The results of the automated SAP landscape discovery are not sent right into the SAP LeanIX inventory but are first captured in the SAP discovery inbox. From here, you can easily yet selectively add items to the inventory.

## Excercise

1. Jump from the inventory into the SAP inbox by following the link in the side-panel.
2. Filter the inbox to "Production" systems using the "Role" filter.
3. Review a few entries in the side panel to get an understanding about the data available for each, and how it will be represented in SAP LeanIX.
4. In the real world you would now pick all entries relevant for your transformation planing. For this excercise, please pick only one (arbitrary) entry, to ensure every participant can import one entry. We recommend to follow the default linking to fact sheets to apply the best-practice conventions.
5. Open the linked fact sheet in the inventory - and continue with the next excercise.
